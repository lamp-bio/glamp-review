We would like to thank the researchers cited here that have helped further LAMP-based diagnostics, in particular members of the global LAMP consortium not listed. We acknowledge the original ground-breaking work of Eiken to develop the technique and the contributions of the Vienna Group (VCDI) to methods development, of the ARTIC Network and GISAID as sources of SARS-related sequence information, and of BEI Resources who continue to supply reference controls to the global research community. We thank ABRF, the Reviewers and Editors of the Journal for their patience, support and encouragement. We are grateful for the Bayan Biomedical undergraduate team at Ateneo for their literature research.
