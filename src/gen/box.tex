%%    README        tcolorbox provides an environment for boxes. These boxes can
%%                  be colored and framed in various ways, as well as containing
%%                  header lines. A box can be split into upper and lower parts.
%%
%%    DEVTOOL       tcolorbox can render side-by-sides of TeX source and output.
%%                  One part of the box displays source and output respectively.
%%
%%    STYLES        tcolorbox has many style parameters for custom box elements.
%%                  We are keeping our boxes simple as a matter of practicality.
%%                  Styles must be able to translate between publishing systems.
%%
%%                  Therefore our elements are simple rectangles with perimeters
%%                  defined by a stroke in one of tcolorbox's library of default
%%                  colors. They have a fill color derived from the this accent,
%%                  but lightened for readability of text contents. Finally, the
%%                  header line has a bolded set phrase denoting the type of box
%%                  in use, such as a Hint, Note, or Warning. It is likely these
%%                  will be swapped out for symbols, for a cleaner, better look.
%%
%%    ELEMENTS      As of writing, we have four box types:
%%
%%                                      ┌──────┬───────────┐
